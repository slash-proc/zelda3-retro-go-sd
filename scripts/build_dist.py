Releases are the source of truth. This rebuilds the whole tree from them every
time, so the site is a derived view that can be deleted and regenerated rather
than state edited in place.

Browsers cannot fetch GitHub release assets cross-origin, which is the entire
reason this mirror exists. `gh` runs server-side in CI, where that restriction
does not apply.
