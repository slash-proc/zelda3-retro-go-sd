"""Emit the dist manifest for one release.

Describes this release per the GWRG distribution spec
(https://github.com/slash-proc/gwrg-dist-spec). One script serves every
project -- homebrew and core alike -- and it contains no facts about
any of them. It is meant to be vendored unchanged; a copy that had to be
edited on the way in is a copy that drifts.

Everything that can be derived is derived, from the built bytes:

  homebrew  the "GWHB" envelope and gwhb_meta_t  -> display name, firmware ABI
  core      the "CORE" envelope and gnw_core_meta_t -> core name, ABI, systems[]

What cannot be derived lives in gwrg.json at the repo root: the converter
description for a project that ships one, and the per-system extras a core
binary does not carry (shortName, compression, BIOS, extension grouping).
Where the two overlap they are cross-checked, and a disagreement is fatal --
the binary wins arguments, gwrg.json only adds what the binary cannot say.

A project-specific invariant belongs in that project's own tests, not here:
this file is vendored by every repo, so a check that means something to only
one of them is dead weight in the other eight.

Usage:
