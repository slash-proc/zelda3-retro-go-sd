# Where the page starts reading. Normally the version index that build_dist.py
# mirrors into this same site: the page offers every version the mirror holds,
# defaults to the newest, and a new release therefore reaches users without
# redeploying this page. Each version's manifest is the identical file a
# third-party installer fetches, and the module and every other file the
# manifest names resolve beside it.
#
# MANIFEST_URL pins the page to one manifest instead, which is what an offline
# bundle needs: a bundle is one version's files in one directory with no index
# above them. Setting it hides the picker.
#
# Release assets cannot be used directly: they are not CORS-fetchable, which is
# the reason the mirror exists (the spec's spec/01-distribution.md).
